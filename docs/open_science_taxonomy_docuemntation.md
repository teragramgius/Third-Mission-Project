# Open Science Taxonomy Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the creation and organization of the Open Science taxonomy, detailing the hierarchical structure, the methodology for converting it into a flat list, and its intended use for Natural Language Processing (NLP) training and analysis.

## Scope and Purpose
The Open Science taxonomy serves as a structured reference for key concepts, subcategories, and keywords related to Open Science. The primary goal is to:

- Enable traceability of terms through hierarchical relationships.
- Facilitate keyword matching and relevance scoring for NLP tasks.
- Support training of NLP models to classify and analyze documents for relevance to Open Science topics.

The taxonomy of reference is the expanded and revised taxonomy detailed in the article "Taxonomy of Open Science: Revised and Expanded" by LÃºcia da Silveira et al., published in Encontros Bibli in 2023. This taxonomy was developed based on the UNESCO recommendations for Open Science and expert reviews.

## Steps Taken
### 1. **Hierarchical Taxonomy Creation**
The taxonomy was defined with a root term (**Open Science**) and several top-level categories, each containing subcategories and relevant keywords. The key hierarchical relationships are:

- **Top-Level Categories**: Broad areas of Open Science such as Open Access, Open Data, Open Education, etc.
  - For top-level categories, no keywords were added since their subcategories and respective keywords provide sufficient specificity.
- **Second-Level Categories**: Specific subtopics under each top-level category.
- **Keywords**: Relevant terms associated with each category to facilitate text matching.

#### Example Structure:
```json
{
    "Open Science": {
        "Open access": {
            "Open access publication": {
                "keywords": ["open access books", "open journals", "green route"],
                "Deposit in repository": {
                    "keywords": [
                        "institutional repositories",
                        "thematic repositories",
                        "consortium repositories",
                        "pre-print repositories"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "Use and re-use of open publications": {
                "keywords": ["copyrights", "open licenses"]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **Flat List Creation**
To simplify keyword search and facilitate NLP training, the hierarchical taxonomy was flattened into a list. Each entry in the flat list includes:

- **Term**: The name of the category or subcategory.
- **Parent**: The immediate parent category for traceability.
- **Keywords**: Relevant terms associated with the category.

Where keywords were not explicitly provided in the taxonomy of reference, additional relevant keywords were inferred and added to enhance utility in NLP tasks.

#### Example Flat List Entry:
| Term                       | Parent                  | Keywords                              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Open Science               | None                   | []                                    |
| Open access                | Open Science           | []                                    |
| Open access publication    | Open access            | ["open access books", "open journals"] |
| Deposit in repository      | Open access publication| ["institutional repositories"]        |

### 3. **File Generation**
- **Hierarchical JSON**: Retains the structure for contextual understanding and hierarchical analysis.
- **Flat List CSV**: Simplified format for keyword extraction, database storage, and NLP pipelines.

### 4. **Output Files**
- Hierarchical JSON: `Open_Science_Taxonomy.json`
- Flat List CSV: `Open_Science_Flat_List_Full.csv`

## Applications
1. **NLP Training**
   - Use the flat list of terms and keywords to create labeled datasets for supervised learning.
   - Train models to classify documents based on their relevance to Open Science topics.

2. **Keyword Matching**
   - Employ keyword matching techniques to score text relevance against the taxonomy.
   - Enable efficient document tagging and filtering.

3. **Taxonomy-Based Analysis**
   - Perform hierarchical analysis to understand relationships between matched terms.
   - Trace matched terms back to their parent categories for contextual insights.

## Next Steps
- **Expand Taxonomy**: Add more subcategories and keywords as needed.
- **NLP Model Training**: Use the flat list to develop and fine-tune NLP models.
- **Evaluation**: Test the taxonomy's effectiveness in real-world document classification tasks.

## Conclusion
The structured and flat representations of the Open Science taxonomy provide a robust foundation for NLP-based document classification and analysis. This approach ensures both contextual accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a valuable tool for Open Science research and applications.
