# Third-Mission-Project

## The Goal
The project focuses on:

- Third Mission Narratives: Explore Italian universitiesâ€™ strategies for societal engagement and innovation.

- Open Science Narratives: Investigate how universities address open access, transparency, and collaboration in their strategic narratives.

- Interconnections: Analyze how open science relates to the broader third mission goals and visualize its role in the network.

## Open Science 
We can treat open science both as a subset of the third mission narrative, and as a distinct entity to analyze its position and connections within the overall strategic framework.
